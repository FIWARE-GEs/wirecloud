## Introduction

This section elaborates on proposed new features or tasks which are expected to
be added to the product in the foreseeable future. There should be no assumption
of a commitment to deliver these features on specific dates or in the order
given. The development team will be doing their best to follow the proposed
dates and priorities, but please bear in mind that plans to work on a given
feature or task may be revised. All information is provided as a general
guidelines only, and this section may be revised to provide newer information at
any time.


## Short term

The following list of features are planned to be addressed in the short term,
and incorporated in the next release of the product planned for
**September 2021**:

* Improved NGSI-LD support. WireCloud 1.4 already incorporate NGSI-LD support
  but it was just an initial version so it is going to be actively worked for
  next versions of WireCloud. Some of the tasks that will be done are:
  * Update NGSIJS library with better NGSI-LD support
  * Release of a set of basic widgets and operators supporting NGSI-LD (e.g.
    NGSILD-source, NGSILD-temporal-source, ... )
  * After this, the rest of widgets and operatos will be updated to support
    NGSI-LD
* Support elastic search 7
* Creation of the documentation and templates required for deploying WireCloud
  using kubernetes


## Medium term

The following list of features are planned to be addressed in the medium term,
typically within the subsequent release(s) generated in the next **9 months**
after next planned release:

* Improved free layout with support for new relative placements (instead of
  always using top-left square as origin) and better z-index management
* New layout modes
* User interface rework
* Use web components for widgets


## Long term

The following list of features are proposals regarding the longer-term evolution
of the product even though development of these features has not yet been
scheduled for a release in the near future. Please feel free to contact us if
you wish to get involved in the implementation or influence the roadmap

* "Responsive" dashboards. Improve dashboard configurability to better
  visualization in different devices: mobile, desktop, video walls, ...
* More layout modes.
